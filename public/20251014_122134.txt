good morning so I want to talk about Boris a little bit which is the little
reading app highlighting app that I've built on the side over the last two
weeks now or so so the bulk of the work I feel like was done in a couple of
days that's where we're at in terms of I'm coding now the models and the kind
of additional tooling around Nostr is good enough that you can actually build
a meaningful app in a very short period of time I think the prerequisite is
that you understand the concepts that you're using and that you have good
taste so with understanding and taste you can go all the way you don't need to read
or write a single line of code like I certainly don't I mean I used to write
software I could but I consciously decide not to I don't want to look at the
code I don't want to see the code I just want to interact with the agents and in
the best case like I feel like I'm I'm almost there maybe in a year from now
we'll be there in the best case I want to interact with the agents with to kind
of voice only voice and screenshots only I don't want to type so lots of my
prompts are kind of start out as voice notes start out as recordings and then
I just feed it into the LLMS to produce something and most of the time the
stuff I'm working on is automatically deployed and then I just if something
breaks it looks weird it doesn't work as I like it to then I will course
correct by feeding screenshots visually input into the LLMS and that's kind of
how I've been doing things for a while now and then works really well like the
the results are actually pretty and usable and yeah I hope that Boris is at
least not ugly I think it turned out quite well it's quite pretty for a reading
app it's it has the things that I always wanted to have and like a
master-based long-form reading and highlighting app it's still not done yet it's
definitely not perfect I guess it will never be but I still want to add a couple
features before I publish it like publicly or be more allowed about it kind of
in stealth mode right now just hacking away at it hammering away at it and I
really enjoy it it's a lot of fun again I learned a lot I learned a lot a lot
about the various nips and the various kinds and how to do things properly and
how to yeah how to build something like a reading app like a pocket or
Instapaper or read wise replacement build something for the long run something
that's not serenative something that won't go away something that can't
rock pull you something where you are actually 100% in the driver's seat when
it comes to your curations your reading lists the annotations you create all
that kind of stuff so that's my motivation for building out Boris and I would
say I'm like 80% there right now it's definitely usable I've been using it quite
intensely the last couple days there's a couple of things that I definitely
want to improve one of the features that made pocket and similar apps great is
that on mobile you can just share to pocket and it's a very quick way to save
something I build Boris as a PWA so I'm not even sure if that's possible but
maybe I'll do a very simple native companion app or something like that just does
it I don't know maybe there's another way for now I use Nostr bookmarks which
might even be better like if you're a Nostr a lot and and you see you see an
interesting link just edit as a bookmark and Boris will gobble it up you'll
find it in Boris again in your reading list or in your bookmark list so that
might be a better approach I might not even need the other thing that I just
described a minute ago and once you understand how it works you can also just
you know post it out or use a Nostr bookmarking app to edit to your bookmarks
yeah I probably don't have to build this myself now that I think of it because
Boris not only takes public bookmarks and private bookmarks it also will display
web bookmarks like nip b0 so any type of bookmark will kind of land in Boris and
be understood by Boris the killer feature I think is that works offline so if
you have a local relay you can just use it as you would normally you can just
create highlights and those kind of things and browse the content that's on your
local relay and I think that's neat that was kind of the point of the
experiment is let's see if I can build a Nostr native reader that works offline
on any device I mean the assumption is that the user has a local relay but I
want to incentivize users to to run local relays and one also incentivize
developers to make running local relays easier I mean on Android we have
Citrine which is fantastic on the desktop we have Nostr relay tray which is also
fantastic for developers with neck and AK V&JF's Nostr Army knife so we have a
bunch of tools and again like if we do all this right if we build this out
right then this stuff will just kind of be around forever like in the sense that
there is no central there is no central authority that can rock pull you there
is no service that can be shut down you can just self-host any part of it you
can use the relays of other people you can yeah even self-host web apps and
the variants various clients yourself and all those kind of things so anyway I
found myself like I really enjoy building this out it's kind of a creative
outlet it's almost therapeutic I had this vision for this reading app for a
long time now like a ridiculously long time like even pre-Nostr I wanted to
build something like that and I think almost three years ago 20 years ago I wrote
orange text purple text orange highlight that's the purple text orange highlights
that's the title and it would kind of sketched out my vision of how this could
work with like swarm highlights and automatic revenue splits using lighting
prisms or using subsplits those kind of things those kind of ideas and yeah
Boris is my attempt to build all this out so again I'm like more than halfway
there maybe 80% there swarm highlights work subslets work highlighting works
offline mode works more or less I still need to fix some bugs there's still a
couple of improvements it's also a good way to discover long-form content using
highlights and I have an explorer page I'm still gonna put in some work into
this because I want to kind of break it down not only I want to be I want to
use it to be able to see stuff from their friends and from the friends of
friends and from the wider Nostr ecosystem so that's kind of the three-tier
approach that I'm gonna build into everything and yeah then I think Boris will be a
great special purpose client and its purpose is to read content mostly what you
save yourself into your bookmarks and so on discover content just by browsing
around and clicking around and yeah seeing what kind of highlights other people
created and so on and what kind of articles they wrote and what articles they found
interesting and it's definitely a scratch my own itch kind of situation so I
built it for myself I am the Boris power user and in the best case there might be
a second user or third one I hope that this will be useful for some people it's
definitely useful for me and it's a lot of fun to build it out and I just really
enjoy building something useful and something beautiful and who knows maybe
I'll build more of this like I've built ants now the search that I always wanted
to have it's also not fully done yet but I'll return to that soon and now I've
Boris the reading app that I always wanted to have and who knows maybe the next one
will be the writing app that I always wanted to have and have some other ideas as
well of course but yeah I think I'm gonna leave it at that I'll talk more about Boris
more publicly at some point in time I probably also gonna write an introductory
blog post about it but I still need to or I still want to kind of polish get rid
of the rough edges and polish it a little bit and just make sure this stuff works
and make sure that I'm happy with it because it's literally it's like gardening
for me right now I just do it because it gives me a lot of joy I don't do it
because I have to do it I don't do it because you know I need to eat or
something I just do it for the fun of it and I think Nostr development should
be like that for the most part I think that's something to strive for at least
yeah so that's enough good morning thoughts for now I think so yeah again I'm
gonna leave it at that
